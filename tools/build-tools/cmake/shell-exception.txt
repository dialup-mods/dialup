😱 This shell doesn't support MSVC environment initialization.

Every one of the eleventy gajillion Microsoft shells is garbo. We get it.

Unfortunately, we can't inject cleanly into Rocket League without compiling with MSVC,
and we can't compile with MSVC without using one of Microsoft's highly regarded shells.

🛠  Use one of the following instead:
  👉 cmd
  👉 powershell
  👉 pwsh
  👉 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022
  👉 VS2022 Developer PowerShell
  👉 VS2022 Developer Command Prompt
  👉 Windows Terminal (with a valid shell inside)
  👉 Build tools prompt from VS Installer
  💅 WezTerm (with a valid shell inside)
